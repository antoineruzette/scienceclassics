# _science classics_
Collection of classic papers in sciences, spanning biology, engineering and physics. 

I read a lot of papers through my academic job - new and old sciences,spanning biology, engineering, computer science and physics. When keeping up with latest papers, I appreciate reading the old stuffs, reading the years of amazing sciences that led to this exact moment. Which papers led to the creation of entire field? To new ways of thinking? To paradigm shift? 

To those who I find influential, inspirational and visionary, this repository is an attempt at archiving your research.
